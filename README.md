## Revision  Upgrade 1 

Upgrade 1 is concerned with putting summaries around the packouts, adding up RTEs by grower pool and changing the source of bins received from the ma_Bin_DeliveryT to the ma_BinT table:

### Summary

Specifically the new features will be:

1. Provide packout summaries by Production site, RPIN (orchard) and grower for each grower. The plan is to create a sub-tab in the the 'Bins Tipped' main tab to include: 'Closed Batches', 'Open Batches', 'Packout summaries' and 'Packout plots'.   
2. Eliminate the 'Packout plot' tab from the main tabs. 
3. Create a 'Packed products' tab in the main tabs which will have: 'RTEs produced' (by number and pool size). 
4. Change the source of 'Bins recieved' and 'Bins received by location and type' tabs to the ma_BinT table from the ma_Bin_DeliveryT table.

### Timeframe

The timeframe is planned for 18th July 2025 (for beta release).  The individual required to test the changes will need to be selected.  Production release is anticipated by 28th July 2025
