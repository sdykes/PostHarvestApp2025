## Rvision  Upgrade 1 

Upgrade 1 is concerned with putting summaries around the packouts, adding up RTEs by grower pool and changing the source of bins received from the ma_Bin_DeliveryT to the ma_BinT table:

Specifically the new features will be:

1. Provide packout summaries by Production site, RPIN (orchard) and grower for each grower. The plan is to create a sub-tab in the the 'Bins Tipped' main tab to include: 'Closed Batches', 'Open Batches', 'Packout summaries' and 'Packout plots'.   
2. Eliminate the 'Packout plot' tab from the main tabs. 
3. Create a 'Packed products' tab in the main tabs which will have: 'RTEs produced' (by number and pool size). 
4. Change the source of 'Bins recieved' and 'Bins received by location and type' tabs to the ma_BinT table from the ma_Bin_DeliveryT table.
